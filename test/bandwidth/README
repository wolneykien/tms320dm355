Hello,

This is the Readme file for my program
called "bandwidth".

This is a benchmark that attempts to measure
memory bandwidth. It's useful because hardware
specifications can at times leave out key facts
about a given piece of hardware. For instance,
two computers may be using 60 nanosecond RAM,
but one of the them may be accessing it 
inefficiently. 

You could run a non-artificial benchmark and 
see that a general performance number is lower 
on that machine, but that conceals the cause. 
So you should run this program, whose purpose is 
to help you pinpoint the cause of a 
performance problem.

Version 0.15a is significant, because it adds 
assembly-language routines which are faster 
than C code, and it measures time in microseconds
rather than the previous whole seconds.

The assembly code is in two flavors:
	- x86 32-bit
	- ARM

Version 0.16 of bandwidth provides x86_64.

Bandwidth performs these tests:
	Level 1 cache sequential read
	Level 1 cache sequential write 
	Level 2 cache sequential read
	Level 2 cache sequential write 
	Main memory sequential read speed
	Main memory sequential write speed
	Video memory sequential read speed (x86 only)
	Video memory sequential write speed (x86 only)
	Speed of basic routines memset, memcpy, bzero. (x86 only)

This program is provided without any warranty
and AS-IS. See the file COPYING for details.
